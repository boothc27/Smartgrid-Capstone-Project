# Smartgrid-Capstone-Project

This is a repository for my contribution to my group's XE401-XE402 Smart Grid capstone project code. This project was published in 2017 and titled "Investigating a Raspberry Pi cluster for detecting anomalies in the smart grid."

This is not a working repository as I no longer have the full data used and these are only my contributions.
